# LegalAnalytics

A pet project. The premise is using AI techniques on legal systems. We'll see where it goes, depending on the data collected. I'll begin by scraping justia.com for case law / legal statues. 

Potential heavily used topics are production interpretters for legal systems or machine learning for case law application.
